# Madlib in Java
This program can take in a prewritten file to allow the user to write a madlib.
I wrote this program to play with strings, arraylists, loops and filestreams.

# Development Enviroment
The easiest way to set up the envirment was to use a Java Repl.it.
Repl.it is an incredibly user friendly enviroment although lacking in features. it is only suitable for small projects

# Build and run
To build and execute this program you can visit this link https://repl.it/@BradenHansen/javaMadlib.

Screenshots of the sofware are included in the repository.

I found that w3 schools website was incredibly direct in giving me the answers to my syntax questions.
